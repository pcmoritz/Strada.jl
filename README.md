# Strada

Strada is a Deep Learning library for Julia, based on the popular [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) framework developed by BVLC and the Berkeley computer vision community. It supports convolutional and recurrent neural netwok training, both on the CPU and GPU. Some highlights:

- **Simplicity** both for advanced users and novices. It is easy to install and also a good platform for teaching.

- **Flexibility** expecially for doing research in various different domains like mathematical optimization, computer vision, natural language and reinforcement learning.

- **Integration with Julia**: Strada is distributed with a version of Caffe that has minimal dependencies and was integrated with Julia's linear algebra subroutines, Julia's tensor manipulation routines and Julia's error handling system.

- **Support of Caffe features**: It is easy to rebase Strada to a different Caffe version with additional pull request integrated (for example with multi GPU support)

- **Open source**: Strada is distributed under a BSD licence.
